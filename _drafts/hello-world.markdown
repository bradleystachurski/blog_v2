Hello World, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Brad Stachurski. It’s 3:14am on October 8, 2016 and I’m in an Airbnb in Lviv, Ukraine. Sounds like the perfect time to start a blog. I’ve been traveling through Europe the past four months. The last two months I’ve focused on learning web development and data visualization. My goodness is this a fascinating area and I’m going to share a little of what I’m learning with you, dear reader.

The focus of this blog will be technical in nature, but I might go on the occasional tangent to write about my past life as a professional options trader, the business I run remotely, or self-improvement topics.

I want to readjust the text for the above paragraph, not the biggest fan of the wording.

Something more like:
Actually, you know what, I think I can just keep that first paragraph as the Hello World post. Then I can have another post that addresses why I should start a blog and what the blog will be about (at least the original aim).
