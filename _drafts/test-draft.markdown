# Test Draft

This seems to be working incredibly well

```javascript
// some test code
var testFuntion = function() {
  console.log('Hello World');
};
```

### Trying the code with Liquid

{% highlight js %}
// some test code
var testFuntion = function() {
  console.log('Hello World');
};
{% endhighlight %}

### Let's try some blockquotes
