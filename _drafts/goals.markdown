A discussion on goals is incredibly important. In this post I want to write about the dangers of goal setting. Looking to change external circumstances as a source for happiness is setting yourself up for failure. I want to talk about SMART Goals. I want to talk about the goal setting podcast by Dean Bokhari.

  - Dangers of goal setting
  - Looking for external circumstances as a source of happiness is setting yourself up for failure
  - Making goals that are outside of your control is dangerous
  - SMART Goals
  - Dean Bokhari's podcast on

Better ways to create goals:
  - Happiness is already here. We don't need to change anything. We can let go
  - There's intrinsic reward in self improvement
    - If goals can help us improve, then they can be worthwhile
  - Goals as a method of focus
    - Too many goals and you have none
    - The ONE Thing
      - On a six month horizon as a value statement

Grain of Salt:
Need to take this advice with a grain of salt, like all advice. These are the dangers I've seen with goal setting and I've noticed a lot of people lackadaisically create goals that set themselves up for failure. I've done it too. My goal of becoming an options trader to find happiness was idiotic.

There's probably more stuff to add to this, but wanted to get this down as a blog post idea.
