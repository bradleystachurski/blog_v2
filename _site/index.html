        Dépaysement
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2016</span>

    <!--<p>I’m wrapping up my first period of extended travel. This journey began in Portugal in early June. I’ve slowly worked my way east through Spain, France, Germany, Poland, and have spent the last several weeks in Ukraine.</p>

<p>I read a book called <a href="http://www.vagabonding.net/">Vagabonding</a> by Rolf Potts a year before I began thinking of going on extended travel. For those unfamiliar with the term:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Vagabonding” is about taking time off from your normal life — from six weeks, to four months, to two years — to discover and experience the world on your own terms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The topic of Vagabonding and extended travel deserves multiple blog posts, if not the attention of an entire blog or book (Rolf Potts certainly thought so). For this blog post, let’s focus on a lovely French word.</p>

<h2 id="dpaysement">Dépaysement</h2>

<p>Traveling has been one of the most enriching experiences of my life. There is so much beauty in seeing other cultures and living life in a foreign land. Even though the journey is full of beauty, extended travel isn’t all good feelings.</p>

<p>There can be an unsteady feeling we get when we’re away from home and in unfamiliar surroundings. Many people experience this while traveling and the French have a beautiful word for it, <a href="http://blogs.transparent.com/french/top-10-untranslatable-french-words/"><em>Dépaysement</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This interesting word can mean anything from disorientation to culture shock. The word is formed from the word pays or “country” and would literally mean something like “to be uncountried”. Dépaysement is the feeling one gets of not being in one’s own country, of being a foreigner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don’t have to be in a foreign land to experience this. We don’t even have to be outside of our homes. When we step outside our comfort zone and try something new, we are often faced with this same feeling of dépaysement.</p>

<p>When we have this feeling, we have a choice to make. We can turn back to what’s familiar and move away from what’s uncomfortable. It seems easier to choose to return to what’s familiar, but when we make this choice we are hurting ourselves. We forfeit a life experience and deny ourselves the opportunity for growth when we turn back to our comfort zone.</p>

<p>Our other choice when we are faced with dépaysement is to stick with the feeling and allow ourselves the chance to grow. This can be extremely uncomfortable, but with time and practice, you’ll become as familiar with dépaysement as you are with Resistance (link to blog post about Resistance).</p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-relate-to-web-development">How does this relate to web development?</h2>

<p>For those new to the world of web development, it can feel a lot like entering a foreign land. The people you talk with speak a different language. The customs can seem bizarre and at times unsettling. Much like traveling to a foreign city, there can be an initial shock and unsteady feelings accompanied with being in unfamiliar surroundings. In other words, learning web development can feel a lot like dépaysement.</p>

<p>This feeling isn’t exclusive to new folks. When you sign up to be a good developer, you have signed up to be a lifelong learner. Especially in the world of web development, it can become overwhelming to try and keep up with the latest trends and frameworks. Seasoned developers also face the feeling of dépaysement, they’ve just had more practice at leaning in to being uncomfortable.</p>

<p>When you come across the feeling of dépaysement as a web developer, you’re faced with the same choice as a traveler in foreign lands. You can either turn back to what’s comfortable, whether that’s your previous career or technologies that you’re already familiar with. Or you can choose to stay with the process of learning and allow yourself to grow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  One can choose to go back toward safety or forward toward growth. Growth must be chosen again and again; fear must be overcome again and again.
  </p>
  <footer><cite>&mdash; Abraham Maslow</cite></footer>

<h2 id="calm">Calm</h2>

<p>This blog post was inspired by a daily meditation from <a href="https://www.calm.com/">Calm</a>, where they discussed the definition of dépaysement. I’m not an affiliate nor will clicking that link make me money. Calm is an app that I’ve been using since February 2015 after listening to a podcast of the <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/02/09/matt-mullenweg/">Tim Ferriss Show</a> with <a href="https://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a>, the founder of WordPress and Automattic. In the episode, Matt mentioned how much benefit he’s gained from implementing meditation in his daily life. After developing the habit of a daily mindfulness practice, I can say this is the most beneficial habit I’ve started since quitting the trading industry (more on that transition in later blog posts).</p>

<p>Sensations and feelings can easily carry our attention away from the present moment. When it’s difficult to be with something it’s intuitive to turn away. But in life sometiems there’s nowhere esle to go</p>

<p>When we’re stuck in circumstances sometimes we have to see reality and adjust</p>

<p>Usteady feeling we get wehn we’re away from unfamiliar surroundsings. Many people experiecne this while traveling</p>

<p>We don’t even have to be in a foreign city to experience this. We can experience this when we step outside our comfort zone and try something new. It seems easier to turn back to what’s familiar and move away from that which makes us uncomfortable.</p>

<p>We forfeit life experiences and growth when we stay in our comfort zone.</p>

<p>\We can acknowledge what we’re feeling and make efforts to stay with our experience and grow</p>

    <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2016</span>

    <!--<p>A discussion on goals is incredibly important. In this post I want to write about the dangers of goal setting. Looking to change external circumstances as a source for happiness is setting yourself up for failure. I want to talk about SMART Goals. I want to talk about the goal setting podcast by Dean Bokhari. I want</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dangers of goal setting</li>
  <li>Looking for external circumstances as a source of happiness is setting yourself up for failure</li>
  <li>Making goals that are outside of your control is dangerous</li>

Need to take this advice with a grain of salt, like all advice. These are the dangers I’ve seen with goal setting and I’ve noticed a lot of people lackadaisically create goals that set themselves up for failure. I’ve done it too. My goal of becoming an options trader to find happiness was idiotic.</p>

        Book Review: Data Visualization with Python and JavaScript
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2016</span>

    <!--<p><img src="/assets/Data-Viz-KyranD.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I received a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review. I am not affiliated with the publisher nor do I receive any financial incentives other than the privilege of reading a book on data visualization for free.</em></p>

<p>On to the book.</p>

<p>This is my first review of any product on the internet so I feel it’s appropriate to offer a short version and a long version.</p>

<h2 id="short-version">Short Version</h2>

<p>Whether you’re new to the field of data visualization and looking for a book to get up to speed, a seasoned veteran looking to see the industry standard of your peers, or anywhere in-between, there isn’t a better source than Data Visualization with Python and JavaScript. You’ll be able to go from a small working knowledge of either Python or JavaScript, to being able to use data from the wild to create professional visualizations with an intimate understanding of every step of the process.</p>

<h2 id="long-version">Long Version</h2>

<p>After reading Data Visualization with Python and JavaScript, it feels like I had a mentor sit down with me over the course of several days to show how a professional data visualizer goes about business.</p>

<p>I’m a self-taught developer and relatively green in the world of data visualization. My background is in finance and mathematics with limited experience in web development and even less experience working with Python to manipulate data. I figured the best way to learn the field of data visualization is to throw myself into a project, so I volunteered to help a startup with their data visualization needs. Volunteering for this task while backpacking solo across Europe and having no coworkers in the field to learn from left me in an awkward spot. How do I learn to create professional data visualizations? The data gods graced me with this text.</p>

<p>The budding data visualizer is entering the field at an exciting time, and Kyran immediately pulls you in and lets you know the excitement is warranted. By the end of the introduction I couldn’t contain myself and was fist pumping the air, eager to consume the wisdom in the chapters that lay ahead.</p>

<p>The title of the book gets straight to the point. The modern way to create data visualizations is to use both Python and JavaScript. Python is used for the processing of data, where JavaScript is used to create the interactive visualization in the browser. Kyran has many years of experience working with the data visualization workflow, and his wisdom shines through in his discussion of why these two technologies provide the strongest foundation for modern visualizations.</p>

<p>To accommodate readers like myself that have limited experience with either Python or JavaScript, the first part of the book includes three preliminary chapters that bring you up to speed on both languages and how to get them to play in the same sandbox. To anyone new to either Python or JavaScript, this alone could be worth the value of the book. For the more experienced developer, these chapters can be skipped or used as a reference without any disruption to the flow of the book.</p>

<p>Kyran approaches the difficult task of driving home the lessons of the book by way of example from the wild. He chooses to use the list of all Nobel Prize winners scraped from Wikipedia. At first glance, this might seem like a dull choice when considering the current domain of datasets in the wild, however as the pages unfold you realize the beauty in this choice. The more insights and stories that are teased out of this “dull” dataset make you question what types of insights you’ll be able to pull from datasets you’ll work with on your future data visualization adventures.</p>

<p>The meat of the book takes this example dataset and unfolds how to create a professional data visualization from scratch to finished product. You’ll be gently guided through every step of the process and the author includes a healthy dose of useful anecdotes throughout that provide color to the process. This is truly a gem for anyone looking to put the pieces together in creating an efficient and modern work flow.</p>

<p>Without spoiling the heart of the book, I’ll give an overview of the main sections of the work flow. The five sections that make up the rest of the book include scraping the data from Wikipedia’s website using both Beautiful Soup and Scrapy, storing this data in both SQL and NoSQL databases, cleaning the data using Pandas, exploring the data using Pandas and Matplotlib, creating a RESTful API to serve the data from both SQL and NoSQL databases, and finally taking the data served from the API and creating an interactive visualization on the browser using JavaScript and D3. If that sounds like a lot of content, it’s because it is.</p>

<p>In order to get the most out of this text requires active participation from the reader. Type in every line of code and follow all the links – and there are several links, Kyran isn’t shy about sending you to different resources on the web. It requires a material amount of time to work through all the examples, but you’ll be rewarded with having gone from a small working knowledge of Python and JavaScript, to being able to create professional quality, interactive data visualizations.</p>

<p>I’d like to address some of the other reviews that complain about typos in the code in this book. As you work through the text, you will find typos if you are taking the time to type in all the code. None of these typos are major and if you’ve been following along and have the patience to do a little problem solving (if you don’t have the patience to problem solve, it might be worth considering a different field), you’ll be able to see the errors and quickly fix them. There is a GitHub repository with all the code necessary to work through the text, which you’ll be able to reference if you get hung up on a typo.</p>

<p>It’s also worth addressing the nature of creating a book that involves web scraping. To include an example that comes from the wild – in this case Wikipedia – you offer an example that is closer to a real-world scenario at the risk of having the website change and breaking part of the code that scrapes. Unfortunately, Wikipedia changed the structure of their website between the time the book was published and when I got to the section on scraping. This is no fault of the author, nor does it take away from the quality of the book. As the reader, you have the ability to update the code to play nicely with the changes in Wikipedia. For those looking to take a shortcut, you have the choice to download the scraped “dirty” data from the GitHub repository and continue working through the text.</p>

<p>These two issues were very minor in the overall context of the book and don’t detract from the value. If anything, the hiccup with the web scraper serves as a valuable lesson in web scraping. Web sites change, so you’ll need to either adapt quickly or find a different source of data.</p>

<p>Bottom Line:</p>

<p>If you’re interested in learning the process of a professional data visualizer and are willing to put in the time, then you’ve found the perfect book. You’ll learn everything from the basics of Python and JavaScript, all the way through using D3 to create interactive visualizations from data served using a RESTful API that was scraped and cleaned by your efforts. It’s a transformative process that can convert you from amateur to professional in a relatively short period of time.</p>

    <!--<p>It’s simple, but it’s worth stating. What’s the one thing that makes a writer a writer? <strong>They write</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s it. The same goes for a programmer. They program.</p>

<p>One of the forms that Resistance (link to blog post on Why Start a Blog) can manifest itself is in allowing us to get distracted from writing (or programming) by spending too much time deciding what tools to use. It can be a trap and I’ve succumbed to it many times. Keep this in mind while reading about the tools I’m using for my writing setup.</p>

        Why Start A Blog?

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2016</span>

    <!--<h2 id="the-why-not">The why not?</h2>

<p>The “why” is such an important question, and sometimes you don’t always have the answer to why you do certain things. Some of the best things that’s happened to me in life have been in response to not overthinking it. Our minds (or at least my mind) tend to find as many reasons as possible to not do something. Some of the thoughts that have been circling my head prior to starting this blog:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Why would anyone want to read what I have to write?”</li>
  <li>“Oh great, let’s add another blog to the world.”</li>
  <li>“There are so many people that are better software developers, data visualizers, entrepreneurs, etc. What makes me feel I’m good enough to share my thoughts with the world on any of these subjects?”</li>
  <li>“I’m still learning. Maybe I should wait until I’m truly an expert before sharing my thoughts with the world.”</li>
  <li>“Will I be adding value to the world or just adding to the noise?”</li>
</ul>

<p>The mind is a funny thing. It doesn’t start to fret only when considering starting a blog. Oh, it does it with pretty much anything. Hearing that lovely voice of doubt is something to get used to. One of my favorite books, <em>The War of Art</em> by Steven Pressfield defines the mind’s ability to tell us excuses when we pursue things that have the potential to make our lives better. He calls it <strong><em>Resistance</em></strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  Resistance will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work. It will perjure, fabricate, falsify; seduce, bully, cajole. Resistance is protean. It will assume any form, if that’s what it takes to deceive you. It will reason with you like a lawyer or jam a nine-millimeter in your face like a stickup man. Resistance has no conscience. It will pledge anything to get a deal, then double-cross you as soon as your back is turned. If you take Resistance at its word, you deserve everything you get. Resistance is always lying and always full of shit.
  </p>
  <footer><cite title="Steven Pressfield">&mdash; Steven Pressfield</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

<p>Resistance <strong>is</strong> full of shit. Thank you Steven.</p>

<p>If that sounds a little dramatic, it isn’t. Resistance is such a persuasive and subtle force that it has the ability to leave you on your death bed questioning “what if?” for your life.</p>

<p>It also has the ability to stop anyone from starting a blog on web development.</p>

<h2 id="the-why">The Why</h2>

<p>There’s good news. Making excuses are what minds do. In fact, we can use this to our advantage. It’s a compass. The more self doubt we have regarding a creative endeavor means that endeavor is proportionally more important to pursue.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  Like a magnetized needle floating on a surface of oil, Resistance will unfailingly point to true North—meaning that calling or action it most wants to stop us from doing.
  </p>
  <p>
  We can use this. We can use it as a compass. We can navigate by Resistance, letting it guide us to that calling or action that we must follow before all others.
  </p>
  <p>Rule of thumb: The more important a call or action is to our soul’s evolution, the more Resistance we will feel toward pursuing it.
  </p>
  <footer><cite title="Steven Pressfield">&mdash; Steven Pressfield</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been listening to the story that Resistance has been telling me for several months. It’s been telling me to not start a blog. I think I’ve found true North.</p>

<h3 id="some-concrete-reasons">Some Concrete Reasons</h3>

<p>(I go a little off track in the following section, but I don’t necessarily want to scrap it. Here’s a quick list of the concrete reasons to start a blog)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start sharing what I’m learning with the world</li>
  <li>I don’t need to be an expert, I just need to be one step ahead of someone to help guide them along</li>
  <li>Let the world know I’m a professional</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog isn’t entirely a spirit quest, or waging war against Resistance. Or hell, maybe it is. Only time will tell. But for now, let’s move away from the woo woo (I do like me some woo woo).</p>

<h4 id="sharing-what-i-learn">Sharing what I learn</h4>

<p>I’m learning things. I’m learning some really cool things. I think it’s time that I start sharing some of this with the world, and a blog is a great channel to reach an audience.</p>

<p>A widely discussed topic in the field of software development (and beyond) is imposter syndrome. According to <a href="https://hbr.org/2008/05/overcoming-imposter-syndrome">Harvard Business Review</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  Imposter syndrome can be defined as a collection of feelings of inadequacy that persist despite evident success
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sure is humbling to learn new things. The more you learn, the more you realize that you’ve barely scratched the surface, especially in a fields relating to computer science. It’s easy to feel like an imposter, especially when you compare your current skill level as a developer to someone that’s been doing this the majority of their life. How can you even say you’re both professionals? Well, there’s one qualification to being a programmer. You have to be able to <strong>write code</strong>.</p>

<p>Creating a blog about web development (and beyond) isn’t my declaration that I’m something I’m not. I don’t have decades of experience writing software for businesses in multiple industries. I’m going down my own path of learning the field, and in order to write something of value I only need to be one step ahead.</p>

<h4 id="exposure">Exposure</h4>

<p>Writing code is intrinsically rewarding. The feeling of creating something that was previously nothing is addicting. Unfortunately, good feelings don’t pay the bills.</p>

<p>Blogging is one of the best ways to let the world know you’re a professional, regardless of your craft. When you start to act like a professional, the world responds accordingly.</p>

<h4 id="selfishness">Selfishness</h4>

<p>It’s good to be selfish.</p>

<p>I started journaling in January 2015 and it’s become a daily habit. Writing can be therapeutic. Sometimes the best way to sort through thoughts is to sit down a puke them out through writing.</p>

<p>Other things to write about in this section:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reflecting on what you’ve learned is gratifying</li>
  <li>Tying back into exposure, starting a blog might lead to financial opportunities</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-stuff-about-trading-that-i-dont-want-to-delete-yet">Other stuff about trading that I don’t want to delete yet</h2>

<p>I’m learning things. I’m learning some really cool things. I think it’s time I start sharing some of these things with the world.</p>

<p>I used to be employed as a professional options trader at the Chicago Board of Options Exchange for the first two years after I graduated college. That sucked. It was my life passion to become a trader. I was so damn giddy before beginning my internship as a trader that I brought a copy of <em>Options Volatility and Pricing</em> by Sheldon Natenberg with me to Machu Picchu.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Brad in Machu Picchu.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>My life as an options trader can be saved for another post (or several posts), but I was incredibly disappointed when I started working in the industry. I quit working in the trading industry after my boss lost all the money in the firm in less than one second a few days before bonuses were paid out at the end of 2014 (again, worthy of a blog post in the future).</p>

<p>After quitting, I needed some time to chill, and boy did I start chilling. I started</p>
