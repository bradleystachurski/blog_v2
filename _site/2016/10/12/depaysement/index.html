  <h1 class="post-title">Dépaysement</h1>
  <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2016</span>
  <p>I’m wrapping up my first period of extended travel. This journey began in Portugal in early June. I’ve slowly worked my way east through Spain, France, Germany, Poland, and have spent the last several weeks in Ukraine.</p>

<p>I read a book called <a href="http://www.vagabonding.net/">Vagabonding</a> by Rolf Potts a year before I began thinking of going on extended travel. For those unfamiliar with the term:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Vagabonding” is about taking time off from your normal life — from six weeks, to four months, to two years — to discover and experience the world on your own terms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The topic of Vagabonding and extended travel deserves multiple blog posts, if not the attention of an entire blog or book (Rolf Potts certainly thought so). For this blog post, let’s focus on a lovely French word.</p>

<h2 id="dpaysement">Dépaysement</h2>

<p>Traveling has been one of the most enriching experiences of my life. There is so much beauty in seeing other cultures and living life in a foreign land. Even though the journey is full of beauty, extended travel isn’t all good feelings.</p>

<p>There can be an unsteady feeling we get when we’re away from home and in unfamiliar surroundings. Many people experience this while traveling and the French have a beautiful word for it, <a href="http://blogs.transparent.com/french/top-10-untranslatable-french-words/"><em>Dépaysement</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This interesting word can mean anything from disorientation to culture shock. The word is formed from the word pays or “country” and would literally mean something like “to be uncountried”. Dépaysement is the feeling one gets of not being in one’s own country, of being a foreigner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don’t have to be in a foreign land to experience this. We don’t even have to be outside of our homes. When we step outside our comfort zone and try something new, we are often faced with this same feeling of dépaysement.</p>

<p>When we have this feeling, we have a choice to make. We can turn back to what’s familiar and move away from what’s uncomfortable. It seems easier to choose to return to what’s familiar, but when we make this choice we are hurting ourselves. We forfeit a life experience and deny ourselves the opportunity for growth when we turn back to our comfort zone.</p>

<p>Our other choice when we are faced with dépaysement is to stick with the feeling and allow ourselves the chance to grow. This can be extremely uncomfortable, but with time and practice, you’ll become as familiar with dépaysement as you are with Resistance (link to blog post about Resistance).</p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-relate-to-web-development">How does this relate to web development?</h2>

<p>For those new to the world of web development, it can feel a lot like entering a foreign land. The people you talk with speak a different language. The customs can seem bizarre and at times unsettling. Much like traveling to a foreign city, there can be an initial shock and unsteady feelings accompanied with being in unfamiliar surroundings. In other words, learning web development can feel a lot like dépaysement.</p>

<p>This feeling isn’t exclusive to new folks. When you sign up to be a good developer, you have signed up to be a lifelong learner. Especially in the world of web development, it can become overwhelming to try and keep up with the latest trends and frameworks. Seasoned developers also face the feeling of dépaysement, they’ve just had more practice at leaning in to being uncomfortable.</p>

<p>When you come across the feeling of dépaysement as a web developer, you’re faced with the same choice as a traveler in foreign lands. You can either turn back to what’s comfortable, whether that’s your previous career or technologies that you’re already familiar with. Or you can choose to stay with the process of learning and allow yourself to grow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  One can choose to go back toward safety or forward toward growth. Growth must be chosen again and again; fear must be overcome again and again.
  </p>

<h2 id="calm">Calm</h2>

<p>This blog post was inspired by a daily meditation from <a href="https://www.calm.com/">Calm</a>, where they discussed the definition of dépaysement. I’m not an affiliate nor will clicking that link make me money. Calm is an app that I’ve been using since February 2015 after listening to a podcast of the <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/02/09/matt-mullenweg/">Tim Ferriss Show</a> with <a href="https://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a>, the founder of WordPress and Automattic. In the episode, Matt mentioned how much benefit he’s gained from implementing meditation in his daily life. After developing the habit of a daily mindfulness practice, I can say this is the most beneficial habit I’ve started since quitting the trading industry (more on that transition in later blog posts).</p>

<p>Sensations and feelings can easily carry our attention away from the present moment. When it’s difficult to be with something it’s intuitive to turn away. But in life sometiems there’s nowhere esle to go</p>

<p>When we’re stuck in circumstances sometimes we have to see reality and adjust</p>

<p>Usteady feeling we get wehn we’re away from unfamiliar surroundsings. Many people experiecne this while traveling</p>

<p>We don’t even have to be in a foreign city to experience this. We can experience this when we step outside our comfort zone and try something new. It seems easier to turn back to what’s familiar and move away from that which makes us uncomfortable.</p>

<p>We forfeit life experiences and growth when we stay in our comfort zone.</p>

<p>\We can acknowledge what we’re feeling and make efforts to stay with our experience and grow</p>

<p>Crap, I barely was able to write what she said.</p>
