Hello World, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Brad Stachurski. It’s 3:14am on October 8, 2016 and I’m in an Airbnb in Lviv, Ukraine. Sounds like the perfect time to start a blog. I’ve been traveling through Europe the past four months. The last two months I’ve focused on learning web development and data visualization. My goodness is this a fascinating area and I’m going to share a little of what I’m learning with you, dear reader. I'll probably throw in a few other topics while I'm at it.
